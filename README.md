# Build Projects with Gradle in Jenkins

This guide will walk you through building projects with Gradle in Jenkins, using the following GitHub repository and branch:

- Repository: https://github.com/manikcloud/Jenkins-cicd.git
- Branch: 4.5-gradle

This lab has three sub-sections, namely:

1. Configuring Gradle plugin for Jenkins
2. Creating a Gradle project
3. Building a project with Gradle in Jenkins

**Note**: Gradle plugin is installed by default. In case you don’t have it installed, you can install the same by following the steps :

## Gradle Installation on Ubuntu

Before creating a Gradle project, ensure that Gradle is installed on your Ubuntu system. Follow these steps to install Gradle:

1. Update package lists for upgrades and package dependencies:

   ```
   sudo apt-get update
   ```

2. Install the required software-properties-common package:

   ```
   sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
   ```

3. Add the official Gradle PPA (Personal Package Archive) to your system:

   ```
   sudo add-apt-repository ppa:cwchien/gradle
   ```

4. Update package lists to include the Gradle PPA:

   ```
   sudo apt-get update
   ```

5. Install Gradle:

   ```
   sudo apt-get install gradle
   ```

6. Verify the Gradle installation:

   ```
   gradle -v
   ```

Once Gradle is installed, you can proceed with creating a Gradle project as described in the guide.




## Gradle Project on Linux Terminal

1. Create a new directory and navigate to it:

   ```
   mkdir my_gradle
   cd my_gradle/
   ```

2. Initialize the Gradle project:

   ```
   gradle init --type java-application
   ```

3. Run the Gradle project:

   ```
   ./gradlew run
   ```

## Step 1: Configuring Gradle plugin for Jenkins

## Step 2: Creating a Gradle project

1. Open the terminal.
2. If you don’t have Gradle installed, run `sudo apt-get install gradle` command.
3. Create a new directory and navigate to it:

   ```
   mkdir gradle-demo  
   cd gradle-demo
   ```

## Step 3: Building a project with Gradle in Jenkins

1. Go to Jenkins dashboard.
2. Click on `New Item`.
3. Enter a name for your build job.
4. Select `Freestyle project` as the build job type.
5. Click `OK`.
6. Scroll down to the `Source Code Management` section and select `Git`.

12. From the drop-down, select `Email notification` and fill the recipient address in the textbox that appears.
13. Click `Save`.
14. Click `Build Now` in the project window to make sure that the build works. Jenkins will now build your project.
